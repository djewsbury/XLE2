	~~~~ Here we map the HLSL register bindings onto descriptors sets for Vulkan
	~~~~ Since our shaders were originally written for DX11, resources either don`t
	~~~~ have bindings set, or they are just using bindings from in one large contiguous
	~~~~ range. For Vulkan we want to separate the resources into descriptor sets, so
	~~~~ here we assign ranges in our one contiguous binding block to named descriptor
	~~~~ sets.
