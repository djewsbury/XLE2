~~~~ Here we map the HLSL register bindings onto descriptors sets for Vulkan
~~~~ Since our shaders were originally written for DX11, resources either don`t
~~~~ have bindings set, or they are just using bindings from in one large contiguous
~~~~ range. For Vulkan we want to separate the resources into descriptor sets, so
~~~~ here we assign ranges in our one contiguous binding block to named descriptor
~~~~ sets.
