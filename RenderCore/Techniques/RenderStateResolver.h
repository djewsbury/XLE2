    /// <summary>Render state settings</summary>
    /// These settings are used to select the low-level graphics API render 
    /// state while rendering using this material.
    ///
    /// There are only a few low-level states that are practical & meaningful
    /// to set this way. Often we get fighting between different parts of the
    /// engine wanting to control render states. For example, a graphics effect
    /// may want to select the back face culling mode -- but the material may
    /// have a setting for that as well. So who wins? The material or the 
    /// graphics effect? The answer changes from situation to situation.
    ///
    /// These are difficult problems! To try to avoid, we should make sure that
    /// the material only has settings for the minimal set of states it really 
    /// needs (and free everything else up for higher level stuff)
    ///
    /// RasterizerDesc:
    /// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ///     double-sided culling enable/disable
    ///         Winding direction and CULL_FRONT/CULL_BACK don't really belong here.
    ///         Winding direction should be a property of the geometry and any
    ///         transforms applied to it. And we should only need to select CULL_FRONT
    ///         for special graphics techniques -- they can do it another way
    ///
    ///     depth bias
    ///         Sometimes it's handy to apply some bias at a material level. But it
    ///         should blend somehow with depth bias applied as part of the shadow 
    ///         rendering pass.
    ///
    ///     fill mode
    ///         it's rare to want to change the fill mode. But it feels like it should
    ///         be a material setting (though, I guess it could alternatively be
    ///         attached to the geometry).
    ///
    /// BlendDesc:
    /// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ///     blend mode settings
    ///         This is mostly meaningful during forward rendering operations. But it
    ///         may be handy for deferred decals to select a blend mode at a material
    ///         based level. 
    ///
    ///         There may be some cases where we want to apply different blend mode 
    ///         settings in deferred and forward rendering. That suggests having 2
    ///         separate states -- one for deferred, one for forward.
    ///         We don't really want to use the low-level states in the deferred case,
    ///         because it may depend on the structure of the gbuffer (which is defined
    ///         elsewhere)
    ///
    ///         The blend mode might depend on the texture, as well. If the texture is
    ///         premultiplied alpha, it might end up with a different blend mode than
    ///         when using a non-premultiplied alpha texture.
    ///
    ///         The alpha channel blend settings (and IndependentBlendEnable setting)
    ///         are not exposed.
    ///
    ///     write mask
    ///         It's rare to want to change the write mask -- but it can be an interesting
    ///         trick. It doesn't hurt much to have some behaviour for it here.
    ///
    /// Other possibilities
    /// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ///     stencil write states & stencil test states
    ///         there may be some cases where we want the material to define how we 
    ///         read and write the stencil buffer. Mostly some higher level state will
    ///         control this, but the material may want to have some effect..?
    ///
    /// Also note that alpha test is handled in a different way. We use shader behaviour
    /// (not a render state) to enable/disable
